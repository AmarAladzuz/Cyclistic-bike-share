### Overview

The director of marketing of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, they want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, they will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Through this project I managed to get some insights into data regarding the differences between bike usage of member and casual riders. I changed data types, created new varibales, checked for duplicated and missing data, removed data and finally did the data visualization.

From the analysis of this dataset we can conclude following:

 - Approximately 3/5 of riders are members, 2/5 are casual.
 - Most rides happen aftenoon around the end of worktime (15-18).
 - Member riders ride bikes consistently through the whole week, while the casual riders ride bikes with increase on friday and weekend.
 - We can say that the average ride duration is consistent through every day of week, both for members and casual riders.
 - Ride duration of casual riders is more then two times longer then ride duration of member riders through every day of week.
 - Most bike rides happen in months with good weather (Jun-Oct), for both member and casual riders.
average ride duration for casual riders is almost two times longer in months with good weather (Jan-20 min: Jul-40+ min), while there is no bigger difference for the member riders.
 - 80% of rides are made with docked bike. Member riders use slightly more classic bikes then casual riders.
